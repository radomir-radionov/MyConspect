## Questions & Answers

<details>
  <summary>What is a data contract?</summary>

### What is a data contract?

**Definition:** A **data contract** is the agreed shape and semantics of data exchanged between systems — API request/response, event payloads, database schema.

**How it works:**

- Frontend and backend share types (OpenAPI → TypeScript codegen, shared package).
- Versioning rules: additive changes are safe; removing/renaming fields is breaking.
- Runtime validation (Zod) at boundaries where types are erased.

**When to use:** REST API DTOs · Kafka event schemas · GraphQL schema as contract.

**Thoughts:** *Contract = both sides know what to send and expect — types and docs enforce it.*

  <summary>Why does scalability matter?</summary>

### Why does scalability matter?

**Definition:** Scalability is the ability to handle growth — more users, data, traffic, or features — without proportional cost or quality collapse.

**Why it matters:**

- Traffic spikes (launch, marketing) can overwhelm unscaled systems.
- Data growth affects query performance without indexing/partitioning.
- Team growth needs modular architecture to parallelize work.

**Interview framing:** Distinguish **vertical** (bigger server) vs **horizontal** (more instances + load balancer). Mention caching, CDN, async queues, DB read replicas.

**Thoughts:** *Scale when you have evidence of need — but design so you're not blocked when growth arrives.*

  <summary>Why is typing important in a team?</summary>

### Why is typing important in a team?

**Definition:** Static types (TypeScript) act as machine-checked documentation and refactor safety across module boundaries.

| Benefit | Team impact |
|---------|-------------|
| Safer refactors | Rename field → compiler finds all usages |
| Clear APIs | Function signatures replace tribal knowledge |
| Fewer integration bugs | Frontend/backend share generated types |
| Faster onboarding | IDE autocomplete explains the codebase |

**Thoughts:** *Types scale communication — critical when more than one person touches the code.*

  <summary>How do you choose tools for a project?</summary>

### How do you choose tools for a project?

**Definition:** Tool selection balances requirements, team skills, ecosystem, and maintenance cost.

**Framework:**

1. **Requirements** — SEO? Real-time? Mobile? Team size?
2. **Team familiarity** — fastest delivery with known stack
3. **Ecosystem** — hiring, libraries, community, LTS support
4. **Operational cost** — hosting, monitoring, CI complexity
5. **Exit cost** — how hard to migrate away later

**Examples:**

| Need | Reasonable choice |
|------|-----------------|
| SEO marketing site | Next.js SSR/SSG |
| Internal admin SPA | Vite + React |
| Typed API boundary | OpenAPI + orval + Zod |
| Simple global state | Zustand over Redux if team is small |

**Thoughts:** *Best tool = fits constraints and team — not the trendiest name on Twitter.*

  <summary>When does MVP beat architecture?</summary>

### When does MVP beat architecture?

**Definition:** An **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) validates a hypothesis with the smallest build that delivers learning — architecture can wait until the idea is proven.

**MVP wins when:**

- Market fit is unknown — speed of learning > perfect code
- Resources are limited — one developer, short runway
- Feature set is exploratory — requirements will change radically

**Invest in architecture when:**

- Product is validated and scaling
- Multiple developers need clear module boundaries
- Compliance, security, or uptime SLAs apply
- The bet is **[AI-first](./0_ai.md#ai-first-approach)** — a clickable UI without a model loop + evals is a demo, not an MVP

**Thoughts:** *MVP = validate; architecture = sustain — don't gold-plate before you know what to build.*

  <summary>Working code vs good code?</summary>

### Working code vs good code?

**Definition:** **Working code** passes tests and ships features. **Good code** is also readable, maintainable, testable, and changeable by the next developer.

| Working code | Good code |
|--------------|-----------|
| Solves today's task | Solves today's task + tomorrow's changes |
| May hide complexity | Names and structure reveal intent |
| Copy-paste OK once | DRY where duplication hurts |
| No tests | Tests for critical paths |
| Tight coupling | Clear boundaries (layers, modules) |

**Interview answer:** *"Working code ships the feature; good code lets the team ship the next ten features without fear."*

**Principles:** SOLID, small functions, meaningful names, tests at boundaries, delete dead code.

**Thoughts:** *Good code is working code your teammate can change confidently.*

  <summary>What technical documentation do you actually write?</summary>

### What technical documentation do you actually write?

**Definition:** Docs that a teammate can use without Slack: **README** (run locally), **ADRs** (why we chose X), **API contract** (OpenAPI), **runbooks** (how to deploy/rollback), **inline types** (TS as docs).

**How it works:** Write the decision and the command. Prefer a 20-line ADR over a wiki novel. Codegen (orval) keeps API docs from rotting. Update the runbook in the same PR as the pipeline change.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Onboarding and incident speed | Docs rot if not next to the change |
| ADRs stop re-litigating decisions | Over-documenting an MVP wastes time |

**When to use:** New hire day-one. 3am rollback. Interview: “I write ADRs for irreversible choices and keep OpenAPI as the contract.”

**Thoughts:** Docs live next to the code that they describe.
